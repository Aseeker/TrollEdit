TrollEdit - Graphically Enhanced Text Editor

TrollEdit is a Qt based text editor developed by students at Slovak University of Technology.

The main goal of the project is to teach students open source development and team management.
TrollEdit itself is an experiment to utilize full AST code analysis during writing of code.
This can have benefits in various common tasks such as moving blocks of code, syntax checking,
syntax highlighting etc.
